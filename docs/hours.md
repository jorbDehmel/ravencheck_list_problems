# Time Logging

This independent study is 2 credit hours. CU Boulder requires
that each IS credit hour corresponds to 40 hours of cumulative
work. Therefore, this IS should occupy at least 80 hours over
the course of the semester. This is an average of 5 hours per
week. To ensure this is true, I am logging my hours spent here.
